Callshastra is a web-based call center application made by Pythrons. The various highlights regarding our project are:

•	Sentiment analysis to judge the customer’s mood

•	Using the collected data to provide features such as analysis of all the call outcomes in various charts. Previous call records with each customer are maintained in detail.

•	The system is smart enough to help the company reduce overheads by generating lists of underperforming and relatively idle employees.

•	Taking an even bigger step in customer analytics, we have also built a system to detect three special case scenarios. First, when the customer isn’t likely to continue within the company’s ecosystem. Secondly, the system detects when the customer is in a state of emotional trauma, and might need professional help. Thirdly, if a customer is extremely angry, the system suggests transferring the call to another executive.

•	An incentive based scoring system for all the employees, which is based around the change in customer satisfaction, before and after the call. This helps improve efficiency.
